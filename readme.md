# DIY Coffee Roaster - 2D CAD Drawings ☕🔥  

## Overview  
This is a **DIY drum coffee roaster** designed using **2D CAD software**, inspired by [this build](https://youtu.be/cGYgEBjoE4A?si=myxJGMCZRqP7O0V4). The goal is to create a functional coffee roaster using laser-cut aluminium sheet metal, making it accessible for home roasters and DIY enthusiasts.  

I’ve designed all the external parts and shared the CAD drawings for free so that anyone can build or modify their own version.  

🚀 **The project is still in progress**—I haven’t cut the parts yet to test the fit, but I’m confident they’ll work as intended.

## 📂 CAD Drawings  
You can find all the **DXF files** in the project folder:  

📁 **[Google Drive - Download Drawings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1biltkYJ_Po8e023H2ts9Ah2g7gEaSzZJ?usp=drive_link)**  

### 🔹 Files Included  
- **Front.dxf** – Front panel with holes for the charging port and trier, plus an inner lid part.  
- **Back.dxf** – Rear panel.  
- **Top_All.dxf** – Three different design variations for the top curve—choose one.  
- **Chaff_Tray.dxf** – Chaff tray that sits underneath the roaster.

## 💡 Why I Made This  
I love DIY coffee gear and wanted to create something that could be **built, modified, and improved by the community**. Since there weren’t any shared open-source plans for a laser-cut sheet metal roaster, I decided to design my own and share it for free.  

However, I **haven’t been able to get the metal parts laser-cut yet** due to cost. If you’d like to support the project and help me bring it to life, you can **buy me a coffee** here:

No pressure—this is just a fun project I wanted to share! If you build one, I’d love to see your results. 🚀☕
